This repository contains my experiements with aim to develop  models, algorithms, working examples, practice material from National DataScience Bowl Kaggle competiton's original tutorials 
for public good and solving real-world problems.

#### Problem Statement for competition

Oregon State Universityâ€™s Hatfield Marine Science Center that captured 50 million Plankton images over an 18-day period. The data is > 80 terabytes of data! 
This competition to find an efficient way of creating an automated classification process to better understand the image contents.

* Extracting regions of interest

* Algorithm that assigns class probabilites to a given plankton image (Classification)
